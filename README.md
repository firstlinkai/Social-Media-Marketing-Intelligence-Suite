# Social Media Marketing Intelligence Suite

## Project Overview
This repository contains a powerful, automated suite of tools designed to provide marketing agencies with data-driven insights from social media platforms.  

The system automates the process of scraping public posts and ads from **Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok**, then uses AI to analyze the collected content and comments‚Äîtransforming raw data into actionable market intelligence.  

This suite is designed for **competitive analysis, audience research, content strategy, and R&D**, enabling agencies to build more effective campaigns. Instead of relying on manual collection and subjective analysis, this system offers a **scalable, repeatable, and objective** method for staying ahead of trends and understanding consumer behavior.

## How It Works: The Core Workflow

The system runs on a **modular, scalable architecture** that moves data from social platforms into a structured database enriched with AI.  

### 1. Input Queue
- Marketing analysts submit search requests in **Airtable** (e.g., keyword, competitor handle, hashtag, or region).
- The request is added to a queue and triggers the workflow automatically.

### 2. Workflow Orchestration
- **n8n** handles automation and orchestration.
- It monitors Airtable for new requests and triggers operations, from scraping to storage.
- Supports parallel requests and efficient resource usage.

### 3. Data Scraping
- **Apify actors** are used for each platform:
  - **Facebook & Instagram**: Scrape organic posts, comments, and ads (including engagement, profiles, and ad metadata).
  - **TikTok**: Scrape posts, comments, and ads (including video content, impressions, business names, and dates).

### 4. AI-Powered Analysis
AI models enrich the raw data:
- **Content Analysis**: Identifies key insights, visual hooks, and supporting proof (e.g., testimonials, charts).
- **Comments Analysis**: Summarizes themes, common questions, and sentiment.
- **Virality Scoring**: Assigns numerical scores to help prioritize high-potential content.

### 5. Structured Storage
- All enriched data is stored in **Airtable**, turning it into a ‚Äúsingle source of truth‚Äù.
- Airtable‚Äôs filtering, sorting, and reporting make results easy to explore, share, and use in campaign planning.
